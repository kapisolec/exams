# examsite
I made this site as a university project. On this site you can add questions, answers, take the exam, and login or register accounts.
Everything is made using Python 3 and Django 3.0.6

To run it properly, you need to download everything and run django server using command ```python manage.py runserver```. After that, server should start and you should be able to see my site at ```http://localhost:8000/```
Feel free to use my code anyhow.
